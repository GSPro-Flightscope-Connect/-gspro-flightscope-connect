# Introduction

This project exists to coordinate flightscope user feedback for GSPro Flightscope Connect interface.
The aim is to advocate for the GSPro flightscope user base through the issues raised against this project to the GSPro software development team.

# How to raise an issue
Go to the issues page for this repository [here](https://github.com/GSPro-Flightscope-Connect/gspro-flightscope-connect/issues/new/choose) where you can raise a bug or new feature request.

Rules:
- Limit issues to the GSPro Flightscope Connect interface only (this is not the appropriate method of raising issues against the GSPro Game - these issue will be immediately closed)
- Requested features/fixes must be aligned to GSPro's intent of providing the most realistic golf simulator (there will be no boost or tuning of ball data)
- Raising an issue does not guarantee a change will occur within the GSPro Flightscope Connect

Your issues will be reviewed/updated by community representatives with issues collated and passed on to the GSPro team.
