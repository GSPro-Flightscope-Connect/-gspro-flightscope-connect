# Managing the project

The project consists of verified (complete issues that meet the rules setout in the readme) issues that are ready for discussion with GSPro Dev.

## Bringing issues into the project

Issues should not be directly entered into the project, they are to be imported from [repository issues](https://github.com/GSPro-Flightscope-Connect/gspro-flightscope-connect/issues).

Prior to bringing issues into the project they must:
- not duplicate functionality of an existing request
- be complete with sufficient details for GSPro devs to easily understand what is requested
- For bugs reproduction steps proven correct to enable GSPro Devs to efficiently reproduce the issue

Once the issue is proven ready for the project complete the following:
- go to the [project](https://github.com/orgs/GSPro-Flightscope-Connect/projects/1/views/1)
- in the Backlog state click add new item (+)
- Select 'Add item from repository'
- Select the issue from the list that appears
- Click 'add selected items'
- Ensure the added issue is in the Backlog state

## Project States

Once issues are in the project they are managed IAW with the following state definitions.

| State  | Description |
|---|---|
| Backlog | List of development requests for GSPro devs prioritised by community reps |
| ToDo | Development requests accepted by GSPro Dev and prioritised |
| In Progress | Development requests under development |
| Blocked | Development requests can be block for many reasons (not enough data, need to prove bug reproduction steps ...) |
| Done | Development requests released to GSPro |
| Cancelled | Cancelled development requests |
